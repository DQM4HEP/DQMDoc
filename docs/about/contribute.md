# Contributing

To contribute, use the pull request functionalities provided by GitHub.

For example, to contribute to the DQMCore package, fork the package with your GitHub account. Clone the forked repository :

```shell
git clone https://github.com/username/DQMCore.git
cd DQMCore
git branch my-pull-request-branch
git checkout my-pull-request-branch
```

then work on the package as you need. When changes are done, do some commits :

```shell
git add 'modified files'
git commit -m "your commit message"
git push origin my-pull-request-branch
```

Finally, go to the official GitHub package page (https://github.com/DQM4HEP/DQMCore/pulls in this case) and create a new pull-request.
