# DQM4HEP : an online data quality analysis framework for physicists 

Welcome to the DQM4HEP pages !

DQM4HEP (Data Quality Monitoring for High Energy Physics) provides tools for high energy physicists to efficiently monitor data taking coming from beam test detectors or full collider experiment detectors.

The software provides the following functionalities :

- DAQ system entry point to feed the system with raw data
- Run control plugin system, interfaced to the DAQ one
- Raw data distributed system using server/client paradigm
- Set of interfaces and tools for data quality analysis adapted to online DQM purpose
- Histogram distributed system
- Visualization interfaces (Qt Gui, web coming soon ...)
- Large scale remote process management
- Generic IO support for raw data transfer
- Client elog interface

The packages are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DQM4HEP).
